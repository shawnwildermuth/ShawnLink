My project for my short link site. Bitly is cool, but 
you can't edit the links. Let's see how much trouble I 
get into here!

I use bit.ly but I hate that I can't edit the links to 
update them. So I decided to build a tiny project to handle
my common links that I might want to update for vanity short
urls. 

Couple of things to note:

- I purposely avoided using MVC or any framework.
- I wanted to use top-level statements to shorten the code
- I wanted to play with Cosmos's Table Storage

Take a look. It's not perfect or production solid. But it 
was fun. 

Here are a couple of shortened links:

- https://shawnl.ist/courses
